								The Dishong Tower Challenge:
								
Can you survive and escape the Dishong Tower, using nothing but what you can scavenge from the tower itself?
						You have one life, one mission, one means of escape.
						
This challenge places you, a lone survivor, in the eponymous Dishong Tower, a towering edifice of death incarnate.
Your only means of escape is to gather everything you need to be able to craft a gyrocopter and make your escape
from the rooftop to the nearby settlement. You have one life. Make it count.

 

A mini overhaul mod, re-imagined for Alpha 21. One tower, one trader, one means of escape.

 

	Four custom worlds, each a different biome, so you can choose your starting "difficulty",
					Forest, Desert, Snow, or the ultimate challenge, Wasteland.

Custom-edited Dishong Tower POI, giving you everything you need to be able to complete your quest.

								Custom questline, guiding you on your way.

	Custom HUD, and in-game options added for toggling crosshair visibility, health bar visibility, etc.
				Pause the game, and look for "Video", then the "Customize" tab.
